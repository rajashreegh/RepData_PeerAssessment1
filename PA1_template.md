## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")

activity$date <- as.POSIXct(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
weekday <- weekdays(activity$date)
activity <- cbind(activity,weekday)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
activity_total_steps <- with(activity, aggregate(steps, by = list(date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE))
names(activity_total_steps) <- c("date", "steps")
hist(activity_total_steps$steps, main = "Total number of steps taken per day", xlab = "Total steps taken per day", col = "darkblue", ylim = c(0,20), breaks = seq(0,25000, by=2500))

mean(activity_total_steps$steps)

median(activity_total_steps$steps)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
average_daily_activity <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
names(average_daily_activity) <- c("interval", "mean")
plot(average_daily_activity$interval, average_daily_activity$mean, type = "l", col="darkblue", lwd = 2, xlab="Interval", ylab="Average number of steps", main="Average number of steps per intervals")

average_daily_activity[which.max(average_daily_activity$mean), ]$interval

## Imputing missing values
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
imputed_steps <- average_daily_activity$mean[match(activity$interval, average_daily_activity$interval)]
activity_imputed <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), yes = imputed_steps, no = activity$steps))
total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_imputed, sum)
names(total_steps_imputed) <- c("date", "daily_steps")
hist(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps, col = "darkblue", xlab = "Total steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), main = "Total number of steps taken each day", breaks = seq(0,25000,by=2500))

mean(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)

median(total_steps_imputed$daily_steps)


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

activity$date <- as.Date(strptime(activity$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activity$datetype <- sapply(activity$date, function(x) {
  if (weekdays(x) == "Sábado" | weekdays(x) =="Domingo") 
  {y <- "Weekend"} else 
  {y <- "Weekday"}
  y
})

activity_by_date <- aggregate(steps~interval + datetype, activity, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot<- ggplot(activity_by_date, aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = datetype)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average daily steps by type of date", x = "Interval", y = "Average number of steps") +
  facet_wrap(~datetype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
print(plot)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
